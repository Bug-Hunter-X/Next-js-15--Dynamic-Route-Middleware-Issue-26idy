# Next.js 15 Dynamic Route Middleware Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and middleware.  The issue involves unexpected behavior when attempting to access certain dynamic routes after middleware execution. The bug manifests as the route not rendering correctly or failing to match correctly. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the unexpected behavior when navigating to specific dynamic routes.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should correctly redirect or modify the response as expected. The dynamic route should render without issue, correctly accessing and displaying the dynamic segment in the URL.

## Actual Behavior

The dynamic route does not render correctly or the route may match incorrectly, resulting in an unexpected display or 404 error.

## Solution

The solution involves careful consideration of middleware logic and how it interacts with dynamic routes. The implementation may need adjustments to ensure the route matching and middleware execution work correctly together.  See `bugSolution.js` for a potential fix. This fix typically addresses the middleware's interaction with the `params` object or URL matching behavior in the dynamic route.
